				My name is Ben Whitton, and I'm a fourth year student here at Millersville. I'm a Bachelor of Design Major, and also have a minor in Computer Science.
				I'm taking this class because I think that being able to build websites will be a useful skill, no matter what sort of job I get after college.
				I also enjoyed the intro class and would like to learn further skills in the area. Other classes I'm taking this semester are Type 2, Vis Comm 2,
				Design for Social Equity and Intro to Computer Art. My favorite design course was Vis Comm 1, I thoroughly enjoyed the professor, and also
				love to design logos and identities, which is most of what we did in the class. I have a passion for illustration and wish that there were more
				opportunities in the design program to learn about it, and if possible illustration of any kind would be my dream job. Other career
				options I would like could be a free lance logo designer, potentially on the side of another job, or website design is also a possibility.
